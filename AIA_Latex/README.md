# Official LaTeX Template for Term Papers and Theses

Caution: Currently there is no officially available template for the corporate design 2019.

This template is meant to be as a replacement of the [old template](https://git.hs-mittweida.de/hsmw-latex/hsmw-latex/-/tree/oldstyle) as well as a preparation of the hopefully soon to be existing corporate design template 2019.
Although there could be more structural modularisation, the document is prepared as a single class file so you have everything you need with minimal preparation and setup time.

You can take a look at _thesisexample_ which is used for documenting the template.
To start your own journey you may want to use the minimal working examples (mwe) _mwe-paper_ or _mwe-bachelor_.
